# model-eye-distortions
STL files of model eyes used in the paper "Quantifying Retinal Size and Shape Distortion in Different Ultra-Widefield Imaging Systems".

## Contents
This branch contains an image file (`figure.tif`) illustrating the design and testing of model eyes and their accessories. The figure provides a detailed visual representation of the models created in Rhino 7 and their applications.
### `figure.tif`
This file contains the following panels:

- **(A, B):** Inner surface of model eye A and model eye B designed in Rhino 7.  
- **(C):** Demonstration of the axial length extension in Rhino 7 using a ring accessory.  
- **(D):** Design of model eye A (left), model eye B (middle), and the ring accessory (right). The walls of the model eyes are 2 mm thick.  
  - Model eye A: Comprised of multiple concentric rings around the equatorial section.  
  - Model eye B: Comprised of multiple concentric rings around the posterior pole.  
- **(E, F):** Appearance of the model eyes and ring accessory.  
- **(G):** Testing the refractive power of a 24 mm model eye using the Topcon KR-800 auto refractometer.

## Usage
- Download the `figure.tif` file to view the detailed design and setup of the model eyes.
