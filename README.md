# Model Eye STL Files

This repository contains 3D model files (`.stl`) for two types of model eyes and a set of ring accessories. These files are designed for simulating different axial lengths of the eye and are based on advancements from the study conducted by Nicholson et al. The files can be used for educational or experimental purposes.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. Model Eyes
- `modeleye_a.stl`: Represents **Model Eye A**, which has four concentric ring centers positioned uniformly in the equatorial section.
- `modeleye_b.stl`: Represents **Model Eye B**, which has a single ring center situated at the posterior pole.

**Specifications**:
- Sphere with an 8-mm aperture (pupil).
- Eye wall thickness: 2 mm.
- Designed to accommodate a +41.95D H-K9 lens for a 0D refractive power in the 24 mm configuration.
- Grooves are 0.7 mm in width, with each ring positioned 9Â° apart.

### 2. Ring Accessories
- `rings.stl`: Contains ring accessories with lengths of **2 mm**, **4 mm**, and **6 mm**. These rings can be used to simulate axial lengths of **26 mm**, **28 mm**, and **30 mm** respectively.

## Fabrication Details
- **3D Design Software**: Rhino 7 (McNeel, Seattle, USA).

## How to Use
1. Download the `.stl` files to your local machine.
2. Open the files in any 3D modeling software or slicer software compatible with your 3D printer.
3. Print the models using the recommended material (black resinous) or a material of your choice.
